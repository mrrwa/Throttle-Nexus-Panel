This Eagle PCB CAD project provides an electrically neutral throttle connection panel that supports either the NCE Cab Bus or LocoNet, but not both at the same time.<br>

It provides 5 sockets all wired in parallel and adds some diagnostic LEDs to indicate:
- LocoNet RailSync presence indicated by the upper bi-colour Yellow/Green LED
- NCE Cable Bus Power status indicated by the lower bi-colour LED with RED for correct or "Good" polarity and Blue for reversed or "Bad" polarity.<br>

## Throttle Nexus Panel - PCB Board
A single PCB contains both the front panel with silkscreen lettering and a break-off PCB for mounting the RJ12 sockets and other components.<br>
